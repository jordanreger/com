    i am a NWS <a href="https://www.weather.gov/SKYWARN">SKYWARN</a> certified storm spotter.
    22 was my first year spotting.
    it didn't yield anything historic, but still proved to be interesting as i was learning about storm development and how to report it to the NWS.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    this page contains a log of notable meteorological events that i've covered (or just... noted).

        <br/>
        the main event of this system was the andover EF-3 tornado.
        i actually have a friend who lived there who alerted me of this storm about 5 minutes after the main tornado had passed through.
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxdFh8nYMgM">reed timmer's video</a> captures some of the most interesting footage i've ever seen of multiple vortices.
