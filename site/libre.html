    borrowed from french/spanish (both derived from the latin root "liber"), libre means (to be) free, unrestricted. [<a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/libre#English">source</a>]

    all of my work, art and information is available for free use and enjoy.
    by keeping everything free, it allows anyone to access it.
    as of now, my contributions are exclusively online - but <a href="/digital-preservation.html">not forever</a>.

  <div class="subtitle">open access</div>
  <div class="body">
    the open access of information is extremely important to me.
    as a believer in science, i know that the truth is always changing because our understanding of reality is always changing.
    this is because our observations (through technology, like JWST, or through knowing where to look) or our methods are getting better all the time.
    however, by spreading misinformation, denying truthful information (and science by extension), by closing access to information or actively redacting it, open access to truthful information becomes limited and as a whole our society gets worse.
    i feel like a lot of problems and misunderstandings we have as a society are due to misinformation or a lack of true information.
    to combat this, we should explore and create in libre foundations in mind.
    here's to exploring, documenting and creating for everyone.
