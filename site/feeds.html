    feeds was built in about 24 hours.
    the commit log is a bit wonky, as i had issues getting it running and then i switched it from <a href="https://lit.dev">lit elements</a> to <a href="https://fresh.deno.dev">fresh</a>.
    development is pretty much frozen now, as it does its job as intended.
    minor bug fixes do happen every once in a while.
