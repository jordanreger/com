i am a software developer in training at WGU.

if you'd like to talk about urban planning, rockets, mountain bikes, swedish, weather, software, google glass, dystopian sci-fi books and movies or something else, contact me below! if you find a social media account with my name on it *not* listed below, chances are it's not mine or i don't use it anymore. it's probably the second reason...
