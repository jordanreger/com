    <b>a note on the aeropress</b>
    <br/>
    the aeropress is a sacred piece of coffee technology.
    ask literally any aeropress user how they feel about drip coffee, pourovers and god forbid <i>drip coffee</i>.
    there is nothing greater than a cup of practically any type of coffee pressed from an aeropress.
    i use my aeropress to determine how good a coffee is - hence, the list <a href="/favorite-coffees.html">here</a>.
