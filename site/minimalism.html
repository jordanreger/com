  <div class="subtitle">minimalism</div>
  <div class="body">
    i've been a minimalist since about the year 19.
    i've found that reducing everything i own to only what i use helps me to think clearer and reduces feelings like anxiety or claustrophobia.
    this isn't for any particular spiritual reason, this is simply because it allows me to enjoy the things i do have more and to make better decisions about what i buy or keep around.
    i apply minimalism to almost every part of my life in an attempt to maximize the impact of the things i think, say, and do.
