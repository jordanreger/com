  <div class="body">
    when you hear the phrase "futuristic dystopia," i bet one thing comes to mind: cyberpunk.
    <br/>
    <br/>

    <br/>
    <br/>
    of course it does &#8212; that's because cyberpunk is awesome (and popular now).
    it's a genre that romanticizes technological progression and the struggle for freedom against some common enemy.
    i believe the reason it's so popular is because, yes, it's cool, but also <i>it's very near</i>...
    we are in a unique period of time where technological progression is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore's_law">constantly increasing</a>, societal problems are getting constantly worse and our reliance on quickly depleting resources is getting bigger.
    we live in the precursor for the cyberpunk-esque dystopia that we all dream about.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    the word dystopia comes from the ancient greek δυσ- (dus-, "bad, hard") + τόπος (topos-, "place") + "-ία" (a suffix), literally "bad place" [<a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/dystopia">source</a>].
    it's often used today to descibe some tragedy or political event, a "societal failure" if you will.
    this is actually the correct usage; it's meant to describe something awful that is rooted in some societal problem.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    futuristic dystopias (at least in media) make one or more of the following assumptions:
    <ol>
      <li>the government sucks</li>
      <li>energy sucks</li>
      <li>earth sucks</li>
      <li>being human sucks</li>
    </ol>
    as scary as it is to think about, these assumptions are starting to become givens.
    our current method of energy production is unsustainable (we've got about 30 years left) and, as if an incoming energy crisis wasn't devastating enough already, <a href="https://climate.nasa.gov/effects/">it's ruining the planet as we speak</a>.
    by now you should be aware of this, as this is widely known and researched (and <a href="https://www.energy.gov/combating-climate-crisis">even the us government admits it</a>).
    however, contrary to the topic of this entire page, this is not a future problem &#8212; this is now.
    so why is it so important to think about our future dystopia?
    because pessimism provokes change, change generates optimism and optimism (rooted in reality) inspires us to create the best future we can.
    that's what we're all striving for, right?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    that's why i think it's necessary to take some time to think about just how scary the present is and just how much scarier the future is going to be if we don't do something about it <i>now</i>.
