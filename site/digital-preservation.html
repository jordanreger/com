    ...is a difficult topic. we live in a world where the cloud rules, where <a href="http://blog.archive.org/2022/11/15/digital-books-wear-out-faster-than-physical-books">digital books wear out faster than physical books</a> and where encryption makes content unreadable (without <i>decryption</i>) regardless of whether or not it's vulnerable. what do we have to show for all our work, all our memories? at this point in history, almost nothing- even though our preservation capabilities are at a maximum. to be clear, i am not against preservation and archiving using technology; all i'm doing is bringing one of our time's biggest problems, turning this era into a digital <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Unconformity">great unconformity</a>...

    this is not a solid action plan. however, my best idea is to <a href="/print.html">print</a> everything. as crazy as it seems, having a physical copy that is observable with our immediate senses rather than through a document reader, browser, etc. that doesn't work with music or video, for example. so how do we do this? i think a good way to do this would be to create devices that run off of longterm energy sources and are designed to do one thing, which is display books, play music, etc. - essentially a purpose-built book but for audio, video and other media forms.

  <div class="subtitle">why do this?</div>
  <div class="body">
    <a href="https://youtu.be/mMaBVfIedFw?t=348">this clip</a> (5:48) from the video "Who Took the First Selfie?" by vsauce provides a great reason. the first death is your physical death, the second death is the last time your name is spoken, and the third and final death is the last time a photo of you is ever seen. because of photography we now have the potential to be remembered for practically forever (as long as the photos are preserved) - yet we're trending in the complete opposite direction. what seems to happen is, every 10 years, someone comes along and decides that the previous iteration of a standardized format for any type of media is obsolete and convoluted, and that they need to fix it. this creates a cycle that can only be broken by creating true standardization in both formats and preservation methods. the "purpose-built books" mentioned above, in my opinion, are a feasible way to do this. as mentioned in the video, the picture of the unnamed lady is <i>still</i> around simply because someone printed it out and has preserved it all this time. i'd like to make it clear yet again that i don't necessarily believe the best way to preserve things is to just keep physical copies of everything because that takes up space and wastes resources (ones that we don't have never-ending supplies of) - my take is that preservation in <i>some form other than in the cloud or online</i> is necessary. my greatest example of why it's necessary is google plus; i spent a lot of time on google plus as a kid, and because google plus shut down (quite a while ago), large parts of the records i <i>could've</i> had that covered a big part of my life are gone forever. as i grow more and start to create a legacy, if you will, i become more aware how important it is that someone, including me, has a way to remember me and what i've done in life. i hope this page will help you realize the same.
