# now
what's happening *now*.

# 22X03
* i lied yesterday - image support did not truly exist, and it's because one tiny little line in my server was stopping all media from being hosted - but only locally and on my backup hosted on deno deploy. so what's going on? what was the little line of code? well, back when i first got into writing webservers i found this one line pretty neat: "let decoder = new TextDecoder('utf-8'); decoder.decode(file_content);" this line stuck from about a year ago until today at about 06:00UTC (01:00EST, where i'm located!!!)...
* print css!
