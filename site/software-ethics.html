    how i build software has changed throughout the years.
    i used to just whip up a <code>create-react-app</code> any time i wanted to do anything;
    now, it's a little more complicated.
    as discussed in probably a lot of my other ethics-related pages, i believe technology is a massive part of our continued survival, but in a lot of cases it's gone too far.
    as mentioned above, i used to use <code>create-react-app</code>.
    a simple project downloads anywhere from 120 to 200<i>MB</i> of <code>node_modules</code> packages.
    read that again. 
    <b><i>megabytes</i></b>.
    just because we have the storage doesn't mean we need to use it...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    today, i still use javascript (pretty much exclusively with deno) and other browser-based 
    <br/>
    <br/>
    recently, however, i've been actively trying to make my software smaller and faster.
    why not?
    aren't we all trying to achieve fast and light software?
    my philosophy now is: <b>if it runs on (raspberry) pis, it flies.</b>
    i have two original raspberry pis, the b+ model (yes, the one from 2014).
    if it can run on those, it's good enough to be considered accessible. to be continued.
