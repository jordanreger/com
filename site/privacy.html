  <div class="body">
    privacy is important, not only online but in everyday life as well.
    to combat this, my usage of social media is extremely limited, and what i do post doesn't include my location or anyone i'm related to (most of the time).
    an especially big "no-no" is posting location information on a time-sensitive platform.
    too many times have i seen news or read articles about people who have been harmed, to say the least, because they or someone with them shared their location information online via "instagram stories" or something similar.
    my point is that the line between digital and real life privacy have blurred in the past decade.
    this is extremely dangerous, because now it's not just the government or facebook, but it's whoever has access to your online profiles.
    this is avoidable: don't post your location in time-specific places, <i>especially</i> if you're still there within an hour...
