    software is not art but architecture.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    software is used to design and build useful things, just like architecture.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    architecture is pragmatic art.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    therefore, software is pragmatic art.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    why make this distinction?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    because art is made for art's sake - software never is.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    art can be made <i>with</i> software, but software itself is not art - it's architecture.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    why can't software be art?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    art can be dysfunctional and it stays art.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    architecture cannot be dysfunctional and be architecture still.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    it is a failure.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    software is the same.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <i>software is architecture</i>.
