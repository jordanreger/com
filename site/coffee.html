    coffee is a big part of my life. 
    i drink it practically everyday, but not because i am caffeine-dependent (i promise, i broke that a while ago), but because i love the taste.
    i can drink it practically any way: black, with cream, sugar, with oatmilk, you name it - i love it.
    i prefer to make my own or let my partner do it, because she's also a coffee fan; very rarely do i get coffee from coffee shops.
