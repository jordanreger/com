    crate is built on <a href="https://deno.land">deno</a>.
    crate is/was a web framework built out of necessity due to most deno (don't even get me started on node) web servers being bloated and having extra features i didn't need.
    at a certain point, it did run natively, but cross-platform applications are difficult to maintain, so that feature was removed.
    now, it's at the heart of this site.
