        it's notoriously big and bulky. while i don't necessarily have a hardware problem right now, it's always good practice to keep your software light (9kb light!).
		using something "less equipped" &#8212; i'd argue left is not unequipped, even though it doesn't have a git tab or extensions or whatever, i'd argue that vscode is overequipped &#8212;  really encourages me to learn about my development ecosystem more than i would with a "normal" editor.
		also, i love the way left (and all of the other uxn roms) look.

		<div class="subtitle">what's so nice about left?</div>
		<div class="body">
			left is a text editor built from the ground up in <a href="https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/uxn.html">uxn</a>.
			what's even more cool is that uxn is also built from the ground up!
			as i search for better ways to do the things i regularly do, i find more ways of supporting artists and people who are genuinely committed to their craft.
			as a software developer and part-time art enjoyer, i think there's a lot of reasons to make everyday things (and in this case, a text editor) pieces of art!
			as i'm sure i'll describe someday, there's a void left in me by modern web design and design in general. minimalism in design is no longer minimalism, but "reductionism," if you will.
			i'm sure you've seen what i'm talking about. design so "minimal" that the purpose of the application or product is dumbed down to a point where it seems single-use.
			with left, you get minimalistic design combined with as much functionality as you'd ever need.
			<br/>
			<br/>
			for a while i experimented with the html version of gmail and i loved it!
			i realized at that moment that the perfect ui is one that lets the ux do the hard work.
			as someone who keeps up to date with web technologies, i thought this was almost impossible.
			good ui design is important, right?
			not as important as good ux design, i realized.
			nothing matters more than being able to use your application or tool or whatever it may be.
			otherwise, it'd be just a good-looking ornament of sorts.
			so, why did i choose left over anything else?

		<div class="subtitle">conclusion</div>
		<div class="body">
			i chose left because it's only what i need, nothing else.
			vscode is efficient for developers who have deadlines, tens if not hundreds of git operations a day, and thousand-line files.
			i don't need that much power!
			i also enjoy the minimalism of left.
			themes are pretty, yes, but nothing beats the look of "old" software.
			in the coming months you will certainly see a shift in my design.
			in fact, my website was the first step of many - <a href="https://indieweb.social/@jr/109253234232129500">it runs on chrome 1</a> by the way!
			software developers are notoriously picky about what their tools look like and do; i am the same.
