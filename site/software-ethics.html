  <div class="body">
    how i build software has changed throughout the years.
    i used to just whip up a <code>create-react-app</code> any time i wanted to do anything;
    now, it's a little more complicated.
    as discussed in probably a lot of my other ethics-related pages, i believe technology is a massive part of our continued survival, but in a lot of cases it's gone too far.
    as mentioned above, i used to use <code>create-react-app</code>.
    a simple project downloads anywhere from 120 to 200<i>MB</i> of <code>node_modules</code> packages.
    read that again. 
    <b><i>megabytes</i></b>.
    just because we have the storage doesn't mean we need to use it...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    recently, however, i've been actively trying to make my software smaller and faster.
    why not?
    aren't we all trying to achieve fast and light software?
    my philosophy now is: <b>if it runs on (raspberry) pis, it flies.</b>
    i have two original raspberry pis, the b+ model (yes, the one from 2014).
    if it can run on those, it's good enough to be considered accessible.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    i still use javascript (pretty much exclusively with <a href="https://deno.land">deno</a>) and other browser-based tools.
    i also use <a href="/wasm.html">webassembly</a>, which i believe is truly the future of the web.
    wait, what about "if it runs on pis, it flies"?!?!
    shouldn't you swear off all web dev and build everything in c?!
    as long as we have connectivity, i believe the web is our greatest tool - software enthusiasts and regular people alike.
    your art, photos, blog, other software, etc. are all available by simply visiting a link... in almost any browser (i say almost because depending on what site and what browser, accessibility is limited).
    so, no, i will not cut ties with browsers; in my opinion, the best way to go about this is to make my footprint via browsers a lot smaller (and maybe make my own browser one day :0)
