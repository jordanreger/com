    today has been a long day of site maintenance, and learning about project management... still.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    also, <a href="https://handmade-seattle.com">handmade seattle</a> (specifically <a href="https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/devine_lu_linvega.html">devine</a> and <a href="https://rsms.me/about">rasmus</a>) gave me a lot of motivation to look into virtual machines - keep an eye on my <a href="https://sr.ht/~jordanreger">sourcehut</a> for more.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    other than that, today i completely revamped <a href="https://feeds.land">feeds</a> into <a href="https://fresh.deno.dev">fresh</a> instead of a mashup of <a href="https://lit.dev">lit elements</a> and html.
    a lot changed, as seen in <a href="https://paste.sr.ht/~jordanreger/bc6164894424f22223005934d821d027d3984348">this diff file</a>.
    fresh is much faster than the previous lit elements monster.
    i also deployed my site on the <a href="gemini://backup.jordanreger.com">gemini</a> protocol.
    this is part of my effort to proliferate and distribute my digital presence, in light of twitter and its... issues.
    i will eventually write an article about the energy crisis, the state of digital preservation, and post-societal technology - when i have another day like this one where i can just write and code all day.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    finally, now this blog includes the <a href="https://jordanreger.com/wiki/tools/0x7D0.html">0x7D0</a> format!
