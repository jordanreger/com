# localhost irc chat
if you are not part of the localhost discord, this information is useless to you (okay maybe not the first part, but the second part definitely is).

## get started with libera.chat
here's how to get started with libera.chat.
1. visit [web.libera.chat/gamja](https://web.libera.chat/gamja) (read more about gamja in [other](/wiki/localhost-irc#:~:text=or%20something%20dumb-,other,-here%27s%20some%20miscellaneous))
2. enter your desired username (use a real one, as there are a lot of people on the libera network)
3. type in the following to the textbox at the bottom of the screen:

```
/msg NickServ SET PASSWORD newpasswordhere
```
4. verify your account through your email (you'll receive a command through your email, insert that into the textbox as well)
5. you've set up your account with libera.chat!

## join the localhost channel
1. tell me your username (by any means) and wait for my confirmation.
2. in the top right, hit the button that says "join channel"
3. put the following in the textbox to join the channel:
```
##localhost
```
4. it should connect, so it's time to say "pog" or something dumb
